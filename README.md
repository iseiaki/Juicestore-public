<h1>Products CRUD Web Application</h1>
<p>This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application for managing products. It was built using Golang as the back-end language and showcases my technical skills in back-end development, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proficiency in Golang and SQL</li>
  <li>Working with servers</li>
  <li>Effective use of Golang frameworks - Gin, Gorm</li>
  <li>Knowledge of MySQL</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to my back-end skills, this project also demonstrates my minimalist approach to design and user experience. By bringing together various elements of web development, I have created a fully functional website that delivers a seamless user experience.</p>
<p>I am dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest web technologies and am committed to delivering high-quality results. Whether it's through implementing new features or fixing complex bugs, I am always striving to improve my skills and bring my projects to the next level.</p>
